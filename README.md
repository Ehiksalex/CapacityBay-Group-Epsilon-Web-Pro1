External Tools use:
bootstrap CDN,
Font-awesome

divided each section using the html section tag
we used bootstrap container-fluid for the hero section to used 100%-width irrespective of the screen size

we used the position absolute to position the floating elements around the image.

We used the grid template to section the cards carrying the courses info

Also we used the @media screen to design reponsiveness for screen below 827px (mobile view for element to adjust to our preference)
